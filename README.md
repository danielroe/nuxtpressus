## 🛝 Try it out locally

You can try the app out locally.

First, [create a Directus instance](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/quickstart.html#quickstart-guide). This project was bootstrapped on [Directus Cloud](https://directus.cloud/account/register/) using the 'Simple CMS' template.

Then, get your administrator token from the bottom of your user profile page, and add it to an `.env` file in your project.

```
corepack enable
echo DIRECTUS_TOKEN="<your token>" > .env
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
